### CMD sets the command and its parameters to be executed by default after the container is started. However CMD can be replaced by docker run command line parameters. ENTRYPOINT configures the command to run when the container starts, similar to CMD from a functionality perspective.

# DaemonSet is a Kubernetes controller that ensures that a copy of a specific Pod is running on every node in the cluster.
